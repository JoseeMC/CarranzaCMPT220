Jose,

About your essay...

- The file was not a pdf file format. Renaming a file to have extension .pdf
  does not make it a pdf file format magically, Jose. You need to export the
  file (or save it) as a pdf. For this reason, I could not open your essay to
  grade it.  -1pt


About your programs...

Functionality

Please make sure you read the problems well; follow instructions.


Style Check

- Most class names do not start with capital letter. They must.


Please make sure you follow the style guidelines and that your programs can be
compiled using javac. Penalties will be higher as the semester moves forward.
