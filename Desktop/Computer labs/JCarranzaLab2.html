<p> My name is Jose Carranza. I am currently deciding to major in either Computer Science.

I come from Brooklyn, New York specifically in the Bushwick/Bedstuy area. I only have a

younger sister. My first anguage was spanish, due to my parents coming from a hispanic 

background. I used to play soccer back when there was time, but unfortunately had to stop 

due to economic issues.</p>
